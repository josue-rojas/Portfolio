# Portfolio

Tools used for this project include HTML, CSS, Bootstrap, Javascript, Jquery, Postgres, Node, and Express.

#### Link to live app
[Heroku](https://josue-portfolio.herokuapp.com)

### Info
There are 2 main pages, the home which is my portfolio where I display some of my projects, and the Blog where it uses postgres database to post and view post.
The home page uses jquery to show and hide containers to sort of filter what should be seen.
The blog you can view post, delete post within a post, and comment on post. Also in the blog page a new link on the navbar appears to write a new post. 

#### TODO
- fix comment section to be responsive
- fix height of comments to also be responsive
- add a bit more style (looks quite boring now)
